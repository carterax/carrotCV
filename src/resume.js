        bodyHTML: `I started my creative journey doodling all over the wall in my house, then I moved next to dismantling our electronics just to see how they work. I decided I would study comupter science in school so I would know how to command machines. 

                At university, it didnâ€™t work out, so I had to study real estate. I kept my computer science friends close so I could learn from them. Fast forward to graudation, I was shipping out websites for businesses run by friends.

                I resumed my professional career as a Graphics designer, but I also prepared myself for a Frontend role. I got the opportunity and was able to build one of the most powerful fintech platforms in Africa, alongside a formidable team of engineers.

                These days, I work as a product manager helping to build an experience @google. I also coach young creatives on how they can get active in the tech industry.....`,
